/*

(a) prime_lt_100[24]
This expression accesses the 25th element of the array (since array indexing starts at 0).

prime_lt_100[24] corresponds to the 25th element, which is 97.
Result: 97

(b) int i=10; prime_lt_100[i+4];
Here, we first set i to 10, and then we evaluate prime_lt_100[i + 4].

Calculate i + 4:
10 + 4 = 14
Now access the array:
prime_lt_100[14] corresponds to the 15th element, which is 47.
Result: 47

(c) prime_lt_100[prime_lt_100[2] + prime_lt_100[0]]
In this expression, we first need to evaluate prime_lt_100[2] and prime_lt_100[0].

prime_lt_100[2] corresponds to the 3rd element, which is 5.
prime_lt_100[0] corresponds to the 1st element, which is 2.
Now, we add these two values:

5 + 2 = 7
Next, we access prime_lt_100[7]:

prime_lt_100[7] corresponds to the 8th element, which is 19.
Result: 19

(d) prime_lt_100[6] = prime_lt_100[6] + prime_lt_100[16];
In this expression, we first evaluate prime_lt_100[6] and prime_lt_100[16].

prime_lt_100[6] corresponds to the 7th element, which is 17.
prime_lt_100[16] corresponds to the 17th element, which is 59.
Now, we perform the addition:

prime_lt_100[6] = 17 + 59 = 76
This means that the value at index 6 will now be updated to 76.

Result: The new value of prime_lt_100[6] is 76, but the expression itself doesn't return a value.

Summary of Results:
(a) 97
(b) 47
(c) 19
(d) Updates prime_lt_100[6] to 76 (no return value).
