/* Explain various parts of the C-code with an example. give short brief answer for a 2 marks question


A C program typically consists of several key parts:

Preprocessor Directives: These are lines that begin with #, used to include libraries or define macros. 
For example, #include <stdio.h> includes the standard input-output library.

Main Function: The entry point of every C program is the main() function, where execution starts. 
It usually has the signature int main() { ... }.

Variable Declarations: Before using variables, they need to be declared with a specific type, 
such as int, float, or char. For example, int a; declares an integer variable a.

Statements and Expressions: These are the actual instructions that the program executes,
 such as assignments (a = 5;), function calls (printf("Hello, World!\n");), or control structures (like 
 loops and conditionals).

Return Statement: The main() function typically ends with a return 0;, indicating that the program 
has executed successfully.
