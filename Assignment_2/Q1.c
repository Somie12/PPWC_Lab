Question:
What are the advantages of using structured programming constructs (like loops and conditionals) 
over the goto statement?

Answer:
Structured programming constructs improve code readability and maintainability by providing 
a clear and logical flow of control. They make the code easier to understand and modify, 
reducing complexity and the likelihood of errors compared to the unpredictable jumps caused 
by goto statements.
