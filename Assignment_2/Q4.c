Under what circumstances should you employ if-else statements, switch statements, or loops?
 What criteria should be evaluated when selecting the appropriate control flow structure?



 Answer:
When deciding between if-else statements, switch statements, and loops, consider the following criteria:

If-Else Statements:

Use When: You need to evaluate conditions that may not be discrete or when conditions are complex (e.g., ranges).
Criteria: Ideal for handling multiple conditions with various expressions, especially when conditions 
are not strictly based on a single variable.

Switch Statements:
Use When: You have a single variable that needs to be compared against multiple constant values 
(e.g., integers or characters).
Criteria: Best for scenarios where you have many discrete cases to handle, and you want a cleaner,
 more organized way to manage them without multiple if statements.

Loops (for, while, do-while):
Use When: You need to repeat a block of code multiple times based on a condition.
Criteria: Choose loops when the number of iterations is known (for loops) or unknown but depends on 
a condition (while or do-while loops).
In summary, choose if-else for complex conditions, switch for multiple discrete cases, and loops for
 repeated execution based on conditions.
